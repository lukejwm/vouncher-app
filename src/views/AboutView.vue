    <h3>A Step Towards Carbon Neutrality</h3>
    <p>
      Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases is essential if we are going to
      prevent potentially catastrophic climate change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brasenose College is determined to be part of the solution. We are
      stepping up to the challenge by working with students, Fellows and select
      carbon offset projects from around the world that the College willsupport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each project removes, reduces or avoids greenhouse gas emissions while
      assisting local communities
    </p>
    <h3>What is Carbon Neutrality?</h3>
    <p>
      Our carbon footprint is the greenhouse gas emissions we cause, expressed
      as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). To achieve carbon neutrality, we must
      reduce our carbon footprint and offset any outstanding carbon emissions.
      Carbon emissions can be offset by removing the equivalent amount of carbon
      dioxide from the atmosphere or preventing the equivalent amount of carbon
      dioxide from entering the atmosphere in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recognise that it is important to prioritise reducing emissions, which
      minimises the need for offsets. Equally, offsetting emissions can be an
      important part of an environmental strategy, particularly where reducing
      emissions is challenging or will take time, as is the case given our
      historic buildings.
    </p>
    <h3>A Step Change</h3>
    <p>
      Brasenose College is reducing its carbon footprint by using renewable
      energy sources as well as cutting direct and indirect energy consumption.
      But we acknowledge that we are facing a climate emergency and we must do
      more, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is why we have teamed up with
      <a href="https://alliedoffsets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
        >AlliedOffsets</a
      >, for the second year running, to offset the carbon emissions from the
      Collegeâ€™s day to day operations. With their help and input from Brasenose
      students, Fellows and staff we will support a number of emissions
      reduction projects around the world.
    </p>
    <h3>Reaching Net Zero Carbon</h3>
    <p>
      Before talking about being carbon neutral, or reaching "net zero carbon",
      we believe it is important to understand what those words really mean. How
      big is our carbon footprint? How much can we reduce it? And how quickly?
      These are difficult and complex questions that we are already exploring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile it makes sense to start cutting and offsetting carbon emissions
      straight away. Preventing catastrophic climate change tomorrow means
      taking action today.
    </p>
    <p>
      We embrace our responsibility to do that, and also acknowledge that
      offsetting carbon emissions in no way diminishes the need to cut our
      carbon footprint as quickly as possible.
    </p>
    <h3>Research &amp; Education</h3>
    <p>
      Research and education are vital to preventing climate change and we are
      proud that so much is being done across the University of Oxford to
      improve our understanding of climate change and to create innovative
      solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crisis such as the climate emergency should be tackled in as many ways
      as possible. We believe that cutting and offsetting carbon emissions are
      crucial actions we should take, alongside research and education, to
      prevent irreversible climate change.
    </p>
    <h3>Accountability &amp; Impact</h3>
    <p>
      Detailed information is available about the four projects Brasenose
      College is supporting and each is carefully audited to ensure that they
      meet their objectives.
      <a href="#">You can find out more about the projects here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>
      Brasenose College has committed to continuing to measure, reduce and
      offset emissions from its own operations.
